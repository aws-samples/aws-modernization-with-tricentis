### The Tricentis Story

As a testing services provider helping enterprises adopt test automation, Wolfgang Platz had the opportunity to try all the software testing tools on the market. Wolfgang quickly discovered that none were able to meet the needs of rapidly-evolving businesses, so he decided to write a business-readable abstraction layer to enable high—and sustainable—levels of test automation.

[Read Wolfgang’s first-hand account] (https://www.tricentis.com/company/the-tricentis-story/) of how this seed developed into what’s now known as Tricentis Tosca and led to the founding of Tricentis.

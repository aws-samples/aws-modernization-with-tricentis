{{< youtube OONpq8aJ85M >}}

#### Objective
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to submit a Defect in a qTest project, which is not integrated with any ALM   

#### Why is this important?
If you encountered an issue while executing the Test Runs, it is important to take note of the nature of the issue, its potential impact and the steps to follow to accurately re-create it.

#### Project Perspective
While executing your Test Runs, you found that the "Add to Cart" button is missing for the products "Copy of Computing and Internet EX" and "Fiction EX". This means, you are unable to order them. As a result, 2 of your Test Runs failed and the associated Requirement cannot be fulfilled.To address this issue to the development team, we must report it and submit a Defect.   
#### Instructions

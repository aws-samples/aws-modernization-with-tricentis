# Download qTest Explorer (Desktop and Web)
----

{{< youtube BV2uv3QnDSM >}}


#### Objective
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to download the program Desktop Explorer and the extentions for qTest Web
Explorer

#### Why is this important?
Desktop Explorer is very useful when your goal is to create Test Cases by recording a Session, submit Defects found through
Exploratory testing, create documents from your Exploratory testing scenario and create an automated script for your
testing.    

#### Project Perspective
So far you have been testing the application from qTest manager, without the aid of any program.   
We now want to record our testing Session for future use, as our team might want to create new Test Cases out of it.

# Create Requirements
----

{{< youtube RZIBQVk0CR4 >}}

#### Objective
By the end of this exercise you will be able to create Requirements and link them to Releases.

#### Why is this important?
We need to identify the main goals of the Software’s functionality. Once identified, the new feature can be efficiently tested.


#### Project Perspective
Customers should be able to Login to the Web Shop as well as order any of the available books by adding it to the Shopping
Cart.   
The right item will have to be present in the Shopping Cart after the order.   
As the tester, you have to create Requirements to define in detail the expected outcomes of the possible combinations of
our variables.   
The Requirements will have to cover the initial Login process, the ordering of the books and the verification that the right
items have been added to the Shopping Cart.
